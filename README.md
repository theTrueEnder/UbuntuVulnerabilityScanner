# UbuntuVulnerabilityScanner
_A vulnerability scanner for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS based off of the CIS benchmark sheet[1] for the distro. This scanner was made for a science fair project._
If you don't run Ubuntu 18.04 as your main OS, you can try the scanner through VirtualBox or VMWare with a prebuilt Ubuntu image [here](linuxvmimages.com/images/ubuntu-1804/)

## Run the scanner
1. In Ubuntu 18.04, ensure that Python 3.6[2] or higher is installed
2. Download the vulnerability scanner
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the scanner was downloaded
4. Enter the following command:
  If you have more than one installation of Python, try:
    `$ python3 ubuntu_vulnerability_scanner.py`

## Disclaimers
- If you wish to create a copy of the scanner code, in part or in whole, the author asks that you add the following line as credit:
  `This program is based off of the Ubuntu Vulnerability Scanner found at https://github.com/theTrueEnder/UbuntuVulnerabilityScanner`
- This vulnerability scanner is made to run and tested in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS running Python 3.6.9. Other versions have not been tested and the scanner is not guaranteed to run on other versions.
- A small fraction of the hundreds of vulnerabilities included in the CIS benchmark are tested in this vulnerability scanner, due to time limitations and the complex outputs of some vulnerability cases.
